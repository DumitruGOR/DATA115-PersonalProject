# DATA115-PersonalProject

## Motivation 

For this data project, I have chosen a data set about the FCS Football team's performance. I have a deep interest in this data because I used to play for one of the teams. I would like to know if the amount of time spend in the league affects the winning rate of the teams? And if there is a relationship between teams with a high winnings rate?

## Data Source

For his project, I have chosen the data about FCS Football Teams and their records of all time. This data came from Wikipedia having 127 Teams with the oldest being Princeton with 151 years in the league and the youngest Kennesaw State with only 5 years in. This data set also containing information on how many games they played during all does years, all their wins and losses, as well as winning percentage. 

## Processing Steps 

For his project, I have chosen the data about FCS Football Teams and their records of all time originally from Wikipedia. Being already gathered and sorted information, the only process that I have done is extracting data. I simply copy and paste the table from Wikipedia to Excell and fixed it a bit. I have made equal column titles and make it look esthetically pleasant.
