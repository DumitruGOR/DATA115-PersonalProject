# DATA115-PersonalProject

## Motivation 

For this data project, I have chosen a data set about the FCS Football team's performance. I have a deep interest in this data because I used to play for one of the teams. I would like to know if the amount of time spend in the league affects the winning rate of the teams? And if there is a relationship between teams with a high winnings rate?

## Data Source

For his project, I have chosen the data about FCS Football Teams and their records of all time. This data came from Wikipedia having 127 Teams with the oldest being Princeton with 151 years in the league and the youngest Kennesaw State with only 5 years in. This data set also containing information on how many games they played during all does years, all their wins and losses, as well as winning percentage. 

## Processing Steps 

For his project, I have chosen the data about FCS Football Teams and their records of all time originally from Wikipedia. Being already gathered and sorted information, the only process that I have done is extracting data. I simply copy and paste the table from Wikipedia to Excell and fixed it a bit. I have made equal column titles and make it look esthetically pleasant. 

## Vizualization 

For my visualizations, I have chosen to make some scatterplots comparing the Winning percentage (Pct.) to the Total Games and Years teams have gained in the league. Furthermore, I have made correlations between them to see if there are any.

In this visualization, I have compared the Winning Percentage to the number of Years they have to spend in the league. Having the Years on the y-axis and Winning Percentage (Pct.) on the x-axis. I have also labeled the teams that I think are outliers ( Kennesaw State, LIU, Dixie State, Houston Baptist, Campbel, Incarnate Word).

In this visualization, I have compared the Winning Percentage to the number of Total.Games they have to spend in the league. Having the Total.Games on the y-axis and Winning Percentage (Pct.) on the x-axis. I have also labeled the teams that I think are outliers ( Kennesaw State, LIU, Dixie State, Houston Baptist, Campbel, Incarnate Word).

## Analysis

In this project, my goal was to see if teams that have been longer in the FCS league had any advantages against newcomers. To answer this question I compared the Winning Percentages (Pct.) to Years and Total.Games. Looking at the plots I can't see any noticeable correlation, they look similar and are kind of in the circle. Looking at the correlations, I can see that there is a moderate correlation of about 0.3o in both cases. I can for sure say that teams with an extensive history in the FCS league don't have any advantage over newcomers
##### Correlations 
Winning Percentage/Total Games = 0.2923842
Years/Total Games = 0.3194701
